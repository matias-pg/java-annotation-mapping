# Annotations mapping

Map deep and complex JSONs to POJOs using annotations.

> Work in progress! This is just a proof of concept where the two most basic annotations (`@MapFrom` and `@MapEachFrom`)
> are already working, but there are more annotations that have to be implemented.
>
> Besides that, the code should be improved. I created this in a couple of hours and my main goal was to get something
> working, so there are things that could definitely be done better.
>
> Also, check the `TODO` in the `JsonMapping` class, where I talk about another implementation that could allow for a
> simpler code.
