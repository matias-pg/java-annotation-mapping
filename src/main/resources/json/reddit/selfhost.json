Note, I don't use any of the above, so I don't have a feel if any of those would be appropriate for my use case.\n\nA bit of an explanation/description...  Each training course consists primarily of video files, with the smallest course being a single video and the largest containing a series of over 100, designed to be watched sequentially, or perhaps focusing on a subset.  However, each course may have other resources, such as PDF files, ZIP files, a series of website links, etc.\n\nAlso, I want to categorize each training by subject, such as Programming, Cooking, Woodworking, etc., that I would want to be able to search for from the top-level of the media server, rather than looking at a flat list of hundreds of training courses.  Note: I made these categories up; I'm not telling Reddit what my hobbies are!\n\nI was thinking that a media server designed for handling a TV series might work for me, as it could handle the modules of a training course as \"seasons,\" and the individual videos within as \"episodes,\" but I'm not sure how it would handle the alternate resources (PDFs, ZIPs, etc.) associated with each course.  It would also be nice if the headings/UI could be customized, so I wouldn't be clicking \\[TV\\] or \\[Season\\] or \\[Episode\\] to get to a video.  Also would be nice to have the ability to choose whether the next video in sequence auto-played after completing the previous one (a very useful feature if watching a course consisting of 100 videos).\n\nBTW, in my search before asking here, I found an app called [OpenCast ](https://opencast.org/features/)that seems similar to what I'm asking for, but its' focus is primarily on the creation of training videos and the serving of the resultant videos is relegated to a rather simplistic \"player,\" whereas my focus/ask is on the media server itself, as I have all the training materials already in a finished format.\n\nAnyone know of a specialized app that would handle my use case?  Or have ideas on how a specific general media server might work in my use case?\n\nThanks!",
